Development for an asynchronous Redis client for Clojure.  Currently under development, not yet ready for use:

### Documentation, TBC.

### Still to-do

1. Complete implementation of all commands.
2. Safer implementation of `parse-response-lines` to not get confused by extra carriage returns.
3. Documentation.
4. Don't specify connection each time if using pipelining.
5. Scripting support.
